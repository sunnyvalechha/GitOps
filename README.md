What is GitOps ?
GitOps uses Git as a Single source of truth to deliver applications and infrastructure.

GitOps tracks the deployment procedure where we can track all the activity done by the Devops engineers as we track in the source code repository.

GitOps is a DevOps framework that uses Git repositories to manage infrastructure and application code deployments. It's an evolution of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and uses Git pull requests to verify and automatically deploy system infrastructure modifications. GitOps can help organizations: Improve efficiency and security, Improve the developer experience, Reduce costs, Speed up deployments, and Maintain consistency across all infrastructure.
